In February 2018 we [reported on new research showing that drivers in UK cities spent more than a day each year stuck in rush hour traffic](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-42917201)

The data came from transport data provider Inrix, who classed rush hour as between 06:00 and 09:00 and 16:00 to 19:00 on weekdays. The report sought a response from The Department for Transport (DfT) and a transport company in Lincoln, one of the more unexpected entries in the list of most congested cities.
